# Fake Zoom Error

I got extremely bored on Online School, it's been attacking my mental health and physical condition as well. So, I've created this fake Zoom error page using some basic HTML. It's not much, but eh. Good for Social Engineer material to skip some meetings.

## For better experience,

I'd recommend using Google Chrome for this. Also, try to resize the window and match with the Zoom background and change the URL with your meeting link (but don't actually press enter if you know what I mean).

## Usage
Just run the HTML file with your browser, it's that easy.  
Works better on Desktop tho, not recommended using Mobile.
